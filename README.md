# seg
Experimental image segmentation using Lab k-means clustering.

### todo

- k-means clustering module
- k-means cluster image pixels based on euclidian distance of `a` and `b` values (directly proportional to visual similarity)
- optimize k-means algorithm with cuda
- find segmentation borders based on pixel centroids
